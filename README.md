# 100-days-of-swiftui

## Day 1
Day one was mostly about learning the basics how to use varaibles,intergers, and how to make strings. 
Honestly IDK what I even want out of this course do i still want to do DS? I guess ill start figuring stuff out.

I dont know what type of apps I want to make yet or even an idea for more complex appp but i hope to start leaning some things.

I came up with a mac os app i want to make its simple because it dosent need data or nothing, I want to make a timer app ill call it 
"Studybuddy". I made a rough sketch of what it is so far.
